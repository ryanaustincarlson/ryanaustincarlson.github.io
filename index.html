    I recently graduated with an MS in <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu" target=_blank>Language Technologies</a> from Carnegie Mellon University. I've been a research programmer at <a href="http://www.carnegielearning.com/research/" target=_blank>Carnegie Learning</a> since February 2014.

    On the rare occasion I'm not at my computer and have some free time, I really enjoy bowling. I have my own ball and everything.
