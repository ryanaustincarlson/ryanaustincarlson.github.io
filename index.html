    I'm an American expat living in Switzerland. In 2014 I graduated with an MS in <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu" target=_blank>Language Technologies</a> from Carnegie Mellon University. I've been a software developer at <a href="https://beekeeper.io">Beekeeper</a>, a startup in Z&uuml;rich, since August 2018. Before that I was a research programmer at <a href="https://www.carnegielearning.com/research/" target=_blank>Carnegie Learning</a>. You can find some of my (very friviolous) side projects on my <a href="http://www.github.com/ryanaustincarlson">GitHub</a> account.

	On the rare occasion I'm not at my computer and have some free time, I really enjoy bowling. I have my own ball and everything. It smells like apple cinnamon. I used to really love black-and-white cookies.
